This is currently hardcoded in `/lib/constants/expense-categories.ts`.

## Setup Required

### 1. Update Supabase Schema

If you already have the old expenses table, run the migration:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase/migrations/001_update_expenses_table.sql
```

If you're setting up from scratch, run:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase/schema.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` has:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit:
- `http://localhost:3000/finance` - Finance Dashboard
- Click the **+** button to add an expense

### 4. Deploy

After local testing:

```bash
npm run build  # Should pass without errors
```

Then deploy to Vercel.
